                    <p>Loopya LLC and its affiliates (Action Golf) operate websites, provide products and services through mobile and other applications, and develop software. We refer to these as "sites," "services," or "our sites and services."</p>

                    <p>These terms, including any schedules and supplemental terms (collectively, these "Terms of Use" or this "TOU") applies to our sites and services on which we display or post a direct link to this TOU. If there is any conflict between this TOU and any supplemental terms to a site or service, the supplemental terms will control. This TOU does not apply to those sites and services that do not display or link to this TOU, or that have their own terms of use.</p>

                    <p>By using our sites and services, you are a "user" and you accept and agree to this TOU as a legal contract between you and us. We may post changes to these TOU at any time, and any such changes will be applicable to all subsequent access to or use of our sites and services. If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of these TOU, now or in the future, you may reject these TOU by immediately terminating all access and use of our sites and services, in which case any continuing access or use of our sites and service is unauthorized.</p>

                    <p>You are also required to comply with, and to ensure compliance with, all laws, ordinances and regulations applicable to your activities on our sites and services.</p>

                    <p>These TOU grant you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive license to access our sites and service and use our sites and services, in whole or in part, including but not limited to our intellectual property therein, solely in compliance with these TOU.</p>

                                <p>We have the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via our sites and services by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of our sites and services) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce these TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). We may, in our sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. Our action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of these TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive our right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.</p>

                                <p>You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by us or any of our directors, officers, shareholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "our representatives" and individually "our representative") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither we nor any of our representatives will be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of these TOU.</p>

                                <p>Although our representatives may moderate content on our sites and services at our discretion, our representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of us will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of us will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by our representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of us or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of us) that we (including but not limited to our representative, anyone else acting on behalf of us, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of us) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that we, our representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of us will in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that we, our representatives or anyone else on behalf of us would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. For the purpose of clarity, the opinions, statements, comments, posts and other communications expressed on our sites and services are solely those of the poster and not ours, or an our employees, officers, directors, shareholders, subsidiaries, parent companies, attorneys or other agents.

                                <p>We believe we will be able to resolve most disputes or issues you may have using our sites and services. In the unlikely event we are not able to resolve a dispute or issue, we prefer to specify now what each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later. Accordingly, you agree to the following resolution process.</p>
                                <p>Since we always prefer to find ways to satisfy you as quickly and efficiently as possible, before initiating any arbitration proceeding, you agree to first discuss the matter informally with us for at least 30 days. To do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern and your proposed solution by email to us at: <a href="mailto:legal@actiongolfers.com">Legal@ActionGolfers.com</a>.</p>
                                <p>If we are unable to mutually agree upon a resolution after the 30-day period, you agree that any claim you may have against us regarding these Terms of Use or our sites and services will be resolved through binding arbitration administered by JAMS and governed by the then current JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. It is important to us that we address any issues you might have promptly. To help us do that, you agree to begin any arbitration within one year after your claim arose; otherwise, your claim is waived.</p>
                                <p>We prefer to resolve our issues with you directly and, accordingly, you agree to arbitrate with us only in your individual capacity, not as a representative or member of a class. As such, your claims may not be joined with any other claims and there will be no authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or brought by a purported class representative.</p>
